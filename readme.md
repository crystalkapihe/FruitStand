# Fruit Stand

I tried to keep as much of what I believed was the intended functionality of the original sample, while adding a few features.

First off, I added a Fruit class, since the fruit stand was dealing with fruits.

It also didn't make sense to me to only have one of each fruit in a fruit stand, so I also added a count, so that the printTotalInventoryValue method would make more sense.

Of course, if we're keeping a count of the fruits, it only makes sense to be able to add and remove fruits from the stand too.
